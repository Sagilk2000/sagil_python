Assignment â€“ Oops

1. Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

Hints:
Use _init_ method to construct some parameters

2. Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.
(Just try )

Hints:
Consider use yield

3. Define a class, which have a class parameter and have a same instance parameter.

Hints:
    Define a instance parameter, need add it in _init_ method
    You can init a object with construct parameter or set the value later

4. Define a class named American which has a static method called printNationality.

Hints:

Use @staticmethod decorator to define class static method.

5. Define a class named American and its subclass NewYorker.

Hints:

Use class Subclass(ParentClass) to define a subclass.

6. Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The Circle class has a method which can compute the area.

Hints:

Use def methodName(self) to define a method.

7. Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.

Hints:

Use def methodName(self) to define a method.

8. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

Hints:

To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class.

9. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.

Hints:
Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class.
